# FdF

"Fils de fer" aka a wireframe.

A simple wireframe map viewer using included 42's _minilibX_ graphical library. Able to read ESRI ASCII grid format (e.g. [maps from NOAA](https://maps.ngdc.noaa.gov/viewers/wcs-client/)) when the file headers are removed.

Has mouse rotations, zoom, colour gradients with RGB pulse and two line algorithms implemented. Reads the file into a badly optimized doubly linked list which causes poor performance on bigger maps.

Written in accordance with Ã‰cole 42's strict norm, no more than 25 lines in a function block, no more than 5 functions in a .c file, no more than 4 parameters in a function call.
